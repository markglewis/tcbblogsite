    <p class="blogHead">The Social Venture Exchange</p>
    <p class="blogSubHead">Words By Taylor Browne</p>

    <p class="blogContent">Social ventures exist to better the world we live in, from the support of environmental
      objectives to raising awareness of the manifold injustices that taint our earth. A social venture contrasts a
      typical venture in that their focus, as one might have guessed, is not solely profit, and although they possess a
      lucrative function, their focus is more towards a social end.</p>
    <p class="blogContent">One thing all ventures depend on, however, is capital. Capital is what drives and supports a
      venture to succeed regardless of its social scope. However, as research has shown, social ventures have a
      particularly difficult time attaining said capital. Over 70% of social ventures report “access to capital is a
      major barrier to success.” If this is the case, how do we make capital more accessible to these social ventures?
      This is the crux of impact investing, and as we’ll discover, a problem with a solution.</p>
    <p class="blogContent">Adam Spence, McMaster alumnus and now Associate Director of Venture and Capital programs at
      the MaRS Centre for Impact Investing, had an idea. What if there existed a matching mechanism between social
      ventures and those willing to invest in them? It would be a sort of stock exchange for social ventures, or, as Mr.
      Spence coined it, “the eHarmony of impact investing.” The idea was first proposed in 2007 and was immediately
      believed to have potential. It was further discussed with government, local leaders in social innovation and
      capital markets, and leaders around the world taking part in similar projects.</p>
    <p class="blogContent">Gaining more and more traction, this idea was eventually endorsed by the Government of
      Ontario as part of its Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2008, and it finally manifested into what is known now as the
      Social Venture Exchange (SVX). The SVX was later further supported with funding by Social Innovation Generation
      (SiG) at MaRS, the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation (MRI), Causeway Social Technology, and TMX Group
      Inc.</p>
    <p class="blogContent">So what exactly is the SVX? The SVX is an access point with the function of connecting
      accredited investors with social ventures and impact funds through an online platform. Ventures are screened for
      feasibility beforehand and ensured to meet a set of requirements before launching on to the site. Such ventures
      fall into several classes: co-operatives, charities, nonprofits, and for-profit corporations. If a social venture
      is deemed to not have financial plausibility or a strong enough social impact, the venture is rejected.</p>
    <p class="blogContent">One of the foundations of the SVX is their new model for raising capital. The model outside
      of the SVX is unorganized and fragmented, making it difficult for ventures to find investors. Whereas the new
      model, involving the SVX, allows social ventures to receive the necessary tools, education, and resources for
      success through the SVX platform. Additionally, given that investors often do not have the time or experience to
      find or make deals with social ventures and co-investors, the SVX is beneficial in that it takes on that
      responsibility for them.</p>
    <p class="blogContent">To further illustrate this idea, let us go back to the “dating site” analogy given by Adam
      Spence. Imagine two entities: an investor and a venture. They do not know each other, they have never met, but
      they are perfectly compatible and both have what the other needs. Instead of wandering aimlessly around searching
      for each other, the SVX brings them together, and furthermore, assists in their marriage.</p>
    <p class="blogContent">Since 2013, the SVX has profiled twenty-six impact ventures and funds, over one hundred
      investors, and mobilized US$3.5 million in impact investing. With the continued support of the SVX, the hope is
      that more and more investors will become interested in impact investing and take part in the movement towards a
      better world.</p>
